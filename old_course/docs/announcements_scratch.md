**Subject:** Welcome to ESS 164 / EARTHSYS 144: Fundamentals of GIScience

Dear Students,

Welcome to **ESS 164 / EARTHSYS 144: Fundamentals of Geographic Information Science (GIS)** for Spring Quarter! We’re excited to have you join us as we explore how *“everything is somewhere, and that somewhere matters.”* This course will give you hands-on experience with spatial data, geographic analysis, field methods, remote sensing, and geospatial tools like QGIS, ArcGIS, and Google Earth Engine.

To help us get to know you and better support your learning this quarter, please take a few minutes to complete our **Initial Student Survey** :
