# Lab Exercise: Cartographic Models in Google Earth Engine

## Objective
The objective of this lab exercise is to familiarize students with the implementation of cartographic models in the Google Earth Engine JavaScript Code Editor. Students will also learn how to utilize the Earth Engine Data Catalog to access and analyze geospatial data.

## Instructions
1. Open the Google Earth Engine JavaScript Code Editor.
2. Create a new script and save it as "CartographicModel.js".
3. Import the necessary Earth Engine libraries and datasets. For example:

## Instructions
To explore the Google Earth Engine interface, you can follow these steps:

Open the Google Earth Engine JavaScript Code Editor.
Create a new script and save it as "ExploringGEE.js".
Import the necessary Earth Engine libraries and datasets.
Search the Earth Engine Data Catalog for relevant datasets using keywords or filters.
Browse through the search results and select a dataset that matches your analysis requirements.
Open the example script provided for the selected dataset.
Understand the code structure and comments in the example script.
Modify the example script to suit your analysis needs.
Run the modified script and observe the results on the map.
Document your findings and observations in the script comments.
By searching the Earth Engine Data Catalog and using example scripts as a basis, you can effectively explore the Google Earth Engine interface and analyze geospatial data.
