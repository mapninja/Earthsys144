## Map Layers  


Map layers are the core components of our cartographic models in QGIS. They represent different types of data that can be visualized and analyzed within a single project. There are primarily three types of layers:

- **Vector Data**: This represents geographic features as points, lines, and polygons. For example, census tracts are often represented as polygons that delineate areas with specific population characteristics. Vector data is essential for modeling discrete features on the earthâ€™s surface, such as roads, rivers, or administrative boundaries.
- **Raster Data**: Raster data is represented as a grid of cells or pixels, with each cell containing a value representing information, such as land use land cover (LULC) classifications. This data type is suited for modeling continuous phenomena, like elevation, temperature, or satellite imagery.
- **Tabular Data**: Tabular or attribute data is often associated with vector data, providing additional information about each feature. For instance, a table might contain demographic details for each census tract.

These layers work together in QGIS to build a comprehensive picture of the geographic phenomena being studied.

### Exploring Map Layers in QGIS

Map layers form the foundation of geographic analysis in QGIS, allowing you to visualize, explore, and analyze different types of spatial data. Below are detailed instructions for interacting with vector, raster, and tabular data layers within your QGIS project.

#### Step 1: Identifying Layer Types in the Layers Panel

- **Open the Layers Panel**: If not already open, you can access the Layers Panel by going to the menu `View` > `Panels` and ensuring that the `Layers Panel` is checked. This panel is typically located on the left side of the QGIS window.

## Zones & Features

In vector data, zones are often represented as polygons, which can delineate areas with specific characteristics, such as census tracts. Each zone or feature within a vector layer can have various properties and values associated with it, stored in an attribute table. This allows for detailed analysis and visualization of spatial data, enabling users to explore and understand the distribution of different phenomena across space.

### Exploring Zones and Vector Features in QGIS

Vector data layers in QGIS are powerful tools for analyzing spatial phenomena, as they allow for the exploration of specific zones, such as census tracts, and the features within those zones. Hereâ€™s how you can dive into these aspects:

#### Step 1: Zooming into a Specific Census Tract

- **Locate Your Area of Interest**: Use the mouse wheel or the zoom tools (magnifying glass icons) on the toolbar to zoom into the area where your census tracts are visible. You might also use the "Pan" tool (hand icon) to navigate to the specific location you're interested in.
- **Selecting a Census Tract**: Once you have a clear view of the census tracts, identify one that you would like to explore further. The boundaries of these tracts should be clearly delineated, each representing a different zone.

#### Step 2: Using the Identify Features Tool

- **Activate the Identify Features Tool**: Find the "Identify Features" tool on the QGIS toolbar. Itâ€™s represented by an icon that looks like an "i" inside a blue circle. Click on this tool to activate it.

This table provides a comprehensive overview of all features and their attributes within the layer.
- **Customizing the Identify Results**: The Identify Results panel has several modes for displaying data. You can experiment with these (found in the panel's toolbar) to change how the information is presented, whether as a list for a single feature or a table for multiple features.

By following these steps, you'll gain hands-on experience with analyzing vector data in QGIS, enhancing your spatial analysis skills and deepening your understanding of geographic zones and features.

## Values & Properties

Values and properties in spatial data refer to the quantitative or qualitative information associated with spatial features. In vector data, these are stored in attribute tables as columns, where each row represents a different feature, and each column represents a different attribute of those features. Raster data, on the other hand, stores values as cell or pixel values, where each cell's value represents the characteristic of the area that cell covers, such as land cover type or elevation.

### Exploring Attributes of Vector Features and Pixel Values in QGIS

Understanding the values and properties of spatial data is crucial for effective analysis and interpretation in GIS. This guide provides instructions for exploring the attributes of vector features as well as the pixel values of raster layers in QGIS.

#### Exploring Attributes of Vector Features

##### Step 1: Accessing the Attribute Table

- **Select the Vector Layer**: In the Layers Panel, click to select the vector layer you're interested in, such as census tracts.
- **Open the Attribute Table**: Right-click on the selected layer and choose "Open Attribute Table" from the context menu. This action will open a new window displaying the attribute table for the layer.

##### Step 2: Exploring the Attribute Table

- **Browse the Table**: The attribute table displays data in rows and columns, with each row representing a different feature (e.g., a census tract) and each column representing a different attribute (e.g., population density, area, etc.).
- **Identify Key Attributes**: Look for columns that hold significant information for your analysis, such as population density, land use codes, or any other relevant attributes. These attributes can provide insights into the characteristics of the features represented in the layer.

#### Exploring Pixel Values of Raster Layers

##### Step 1: Using the Identify Features Tool

- **Activate the Identify Features Tool**: Locate and click on the "Identify Features" tool in the toolbar, symbolized by an "i" inside a blue circle.
- **Select a Raster Layer**: Ensure that the raster layer you wish to explore (e.g., an LULC classification layer) is selected and visible in the Layers Panel.

##### Step 2: Clicking on the Raster to Identify Pixel Values

- **Click on the Map Canvas**: With the Identify Features tool active, click on a point within the raster layer displayed on the map canvas. This will query the pixel at the location you clicked.
- **Examine the Pixel Values**: The "Identify Results" panel will open, showing the value of the pixel you selected. If the raster layer contains multiple bands (such as in multi-spectral satellite imagery), you will see the values for each band. These values might represent different types of information depending on the nature of the raster data, such as land cover categories, elevation, or spectral reflectance values.

### Tips for Effective Exploration

- **Filtering in the Attribute Table**: Use the filtering and searching functionalities within the attribute table to narrow down to features of interest based on specific criteria, enhancing your ability to focus on relevant data.
- **Understanding Raster Values**: For raster layers, understanding what the pixel values represent is key to analysis. Refer to the metadata or documentation of the dataset to interpret these values correctly.
- **Visualizing Data**: Consider using QGIS's styling options to visualize vector attributes or raster values on the map, such as through thematic mapping or applying different color ramps to raster data. This can help in visually identifying patterns or anomalies within your data.

By following these steps, you'll be able to effectively explore and understand the attributes and values associated with both vector and raster layers in QGIS, laying a solid foundation for your spatial analysis endeavors.

## Locations & Coordinate Reference Systems

Understanding locations and Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) is fundamental to spatial thinking. Locations on Earth can be represented in many ways, but in GIS, we use coordinate systems to map these locations accurately onto a two-dimensional surface.

- **Geographic Coordinate Systems (GCS)** use latitude and longitude to describe the location of any point on the earth's surface. These coordinates are measured in degrees and represent angles from the Earth's center to a point on the Earth's surface.
- **Projected Coordinate Systems (PCS)**, on the other hand, project or translate the Earth's spherical surface onto a flat plane, making it easier to measure distances and areas accurately. This process inevitably introduces some distortion, which varies depending on the projection used.

Both types of CRS are crucial for accurately mapping and analyzing spatial data. In QGIS, users must be mindful of the CRS of their data layers to ensure accurate representation and analysis. Future labs will delve deeper into how different CRSs affect spatial analysis and how to choose the appropriate CRS for your project needs.

### Exploring Locations and Coordinate Reference Systems in QGIS

In QGIS, understanding and managing Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) is crucial for accurate spatial analysis. The CRS defines how the two-dimensional, projected map in your GIS relates to real places on the earth. Consider the CRS as the "lingua franca" of your project, ensuring that all layers speak the same spatial language for seamless integration and analysis.

#### Step 1: Investigating Layer CRS

- **Select a Layer**: In the Layers Panel, click on any layer you're interested in to select it.
- **Access Layer Properties**: Right-click on the selected layer and choose "Properties" from the context menu.
- **Find CRS Information**: In the Layer Properties window, click on the "Information" tab. Here, you will find the CRS for the layer specified under the "Coordinate Reference System" section.
- **Note the CRS**: Pay attention to whether the layer uses a Geographic Coordinate System (GCS) or a Projected Coordinate System (PCS). The description will include the EPSG (European Petroleum Survey Group) code, which is a unique identifier for specific CRS, and details about the projection or datum used.

#### Step 2: Understanding the Project CRS

- **Access Project Properties**: Go to "Project" > "Properties" from the main menu.
- **Navigate to CRS Settings**: Click on the "CRS" tab in the Project Properties window.
- **Project CRS as Reference System**: The Project CRS can be thought of as the common language or "lingua franca" for your GIS project. It's the standard against which all layers are displayed or analyzed together. If layers in your project have different CRS, QGIS can reproject them on the fly to match the Project CRS. However, for accuracy and performance, it's often better to have all layers in the same CRS.
- **Changing the Project CRS**: If needed, you can change the Project CRS by searching for a CRS by name or EPSG code and selecting it. Remember, changing the Project CRS does not alter the underlying data of your layers; it only changes how they are projected in the current project.

#### The Relationship Between Project CRS and Layer CRS

Understanding the relationship between the Project CRS and Layer CRS is essential:

- **Consistency is Key**: For accurate spatial analysis, all layers should ideally be in the same CRS. This ensures that measurements, distances, and areas are consistent across your project.
- **On-the-fly Reprojection**: QGIS automatically reprojects layers to the Project CRS during visualization. While convenient, this can sometimes lead to inaccuracies or performance issues, especially with large datasets.
- **Checking Layer Compatibility**: Before starting an analysis, check that all layers are compatible with your Project CRS. If not, consider reprojecting your layers to match the Project CRS using the "Reproject layer" tool under "Processing" > "Toolbox" in QGIS.

### Practical Tips

- **Be Mindful of Distortions**: Different projections can introduce different types of distortions (area, distance, direction, shape). Choose a Project CRS that minimizes distortion for the type of analysis you're conducting.
- **Verify Layer CRS When Adding Data**: Always check the CRS of new layers when you add them to your project. If they do not match your Project CRS, consider reprojecting them.
- **Use EPSG Codes for Precision**: When communicating or searching for CRS, use the EPSG code to avoid confusion, as different systems might have similar names.

By carefully managing CRS settings in your QGIS project, you ensure that your spatial analysis is grounded in an accurate representation of real-world locations, making your conclusions more reliable and meaningful.
