# Logging in to Google Earth Engine

## Introduction

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a powerful cloud-based platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis. Setting up your access properly is crucial for the cloud-based components of this course. This lab will guide you through the account setup process and teach you essential sharing practices.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Navigate to the Google Earth Engine Code Editor
- Create your first Google Cloud Project and: 1. enable it for non-commercial use; 2. Set the Compute Tier to "Community" and; 3. Enable the Earth Engine API.
- Share your work using proper link sharing protocols

## Google Earth Engine Login & Project Creation

### First Login

1. Navigate to [code.earthengine.google.com](https://code.earthengine.google.com)
2. Accept the terms of service
3. Explore the interface: Code Editor, Console, Map, and Asset Manager

### Link Sharing Best Practices

Sharing your Google Earth Engine scripts properly:

- Use the "Get Link" button to create shareable URLs
- Set appropriate permissions (view vs. edit access)
- Test links in an incognito window to verify access
- Include link sharing in all homework submissions

## Additional Accounts Setup

ArcGIS Online provides web mapping and story mapping capabilities:

1. Visit [stanford.maps.arcgis.com](https://stanford.maps.arcgis.com)
2. Click on the Login
3. Verify your email address
4. Explore the interface and sample content

### Github.com

We will primarily be using GitHub.com to host webmaps and experiments with 

1. Visit [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Create a free account with your SUNetID credentials. Using your [*.edu credentials gives you access to many free extras](https://github.com/education/students)!
3. Apply for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack?sort=popularity&tag=All)!
4. Verify your Stanford email for educational benefits

### Google Colab

Google Colab provides the ability to run cloud-based Python notebooks, using your SUNetID Credentials for login:

1. Visit [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Sign in with your SUNetID & Password
3. Create a test notebook to verify access
4. Connect to runtime and test basic Python commands

### Stanford AFS Web Hosting

Stanford's AFS system provides [web hosting for students](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/web/centralhosting/howto_user).  You can place basic HTML/JS/CSS applications on your AFS space and then access those applications at: `web.stanford.edu/~YOURSUNetID`

1. Visit: [https://uit.stanford.edu/service/web/centralhosting/howto_user](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/web/centralhosting/howto_user) to find out more about your AFS Web Hosting.
2. Use [Secure FTP](https://uit.stanford.edu/software/scrt_sfx) to transfer your files into your /WWW/ folder.
3. Test by uploading a [simple HTML file](https://github.com/mapninja/Earthsys144/blob/gh-pages/data/test_afs.html)
