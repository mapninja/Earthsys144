# Earthsys144 - Fundamentals of Geographic Information Science

Here you will find the Earthsys144 and ESS164 labs, as they are completed and assigned.

Please note that exercises in this repo that have not yet been released in Canvas may be in a state of 'becoming' and that changes to the assignments may occur up to the point that I release the assignments in Canvas.
