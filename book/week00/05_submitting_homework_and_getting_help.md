# Submitting Homework and Getting Help

## Introduction

Effective communication is crucial in spatial data science - both when submitting your work and when seeking assistance. This lab teaches you the essential skills for properly formatting and submitting various types of assignments, as well as how to effectively seek help when you encounter technical problems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Submit homework in proper formats (images, PDFs, links)
- Create high-quality screenshots and documentation
- Write effective issue reports and help requests
- Use GitHub's issue tracking system
- Share Google Earth Engine scripts for troubleshooting
- Follow best practices for academic integrity and collaboration

## 1. Submitting Homework

### 1.1 Submitting Images

Proper image submission guidelines:

**Format Requirements:**

- PNG for maps and screenshots (lossless compression)
- JPEG for photographs (smaller file size)
- Avoid proprietary formats (TIFF, BMP)

**Quality Standards:**

- Sufficient resolution for clear reading
- Appropriate file size (typically < 5MB)
- Descriptive filenames
- Include scale and north arrow when relevant

### 1.2 Submitting PDFs

PDF is often required for formal map layouts:

**Creating PDFs from QGIS:**

1. Use Print Layout for professional cartographic output
2. Set appropriate page size and margins
3. Include title, legend, scale bar, and north arrow
4. Export as PDF with high resolution (300 DPI minimum)

**Common PDF Problems and Solutions:**

- **Fonts not embedded**: Use standard fonts or embed all fonts
- **Images appear pixelated**: Increase raster resolution in export settings
- **File size too large**: Optimize images before adding to layout
- **Colors look different**: Use RGB color space for screen viewing

### 1.3 Submitting Links

Many assignments require link submission:

**Link Types:**

- GitHub repository URLs
- Google Earth Engine shared scripts
- ArcGIS Online web maps
- Google Colab notebooks

**Best Practices:**

- Test links in private/incognito browser window
- Ensure proper permissions are set
- Use descriptive link text
- Include brief description of linked content

## 2. Getting Help

### 2.1 Writing an "Issue"

Learn to document problems effectively:

**Good Issue Reports Include:**

- Clear, descriptive title
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- System information (OS, software versions)
- Screenshots or error messages
- What you've already tried

### 2.2 Screenshots for Technical Support

Effective screenshots for getting help:

- Show the entire relevant interface
- Include error messages in full
- Highlight the problem area
- Show system information when relevant
- Capture before and after states when possible

### 2.3 Google Earth Engine Get Link

Sharing GEE scripts for troubleshooting:

1. Click the "Get Link" button in the Code Editor
2. Choose appropriate permissions (View vs. Edit)
3. Copy the generated URL
4. Test the link in an incognito window
5. Include the link in your help request

### 2.4 Submitting Issues on GitHub

Using GitHub's issue tracking system:

**For QGIS Issues:**

1. Search existing issues first
2. Use the QGIS GitHub repository
3. Follow the issue template
4. Include sample data when possible
5. Tag appropriately

**For Course Issues:**

1. Use the course repository issue tracker
2. Include assignment or lab context
3. Reference specific instructions or requirements
4. Be respectful and professional

## 3. Communication Best Practices

### 3.1 Professional Communication

When seeking help or submitting work:

- Use clear, professional language
- Be specific about the problem or question
- Provide context for your work
- Show what you've already attempted
- Be patient and respectful

### 3.2 Academic Integrity

Guidelines for collaboration and individual work:

- Clearly attribute any code or methods borrowed from others
- Collaborate appropriately based on assignment guidelines
- Ask for clarification when collaboration rules are unclear
- Maintain your own backup copies of all work

### 3.3 Time Management

Effective strategies for managing coursework:

- Start assignments early to allow time for troubleshooting
- Keep organized records of your work process
- Document problems as they occur
- Seek help promptly rather than struggling alone

## Conclusion

Mastering these communication and submission skills will serve you well throughout the course and in your future career. Remember that asking for help is a sign of engagement, not weakness, and that clear documentation of your work process is valuable both for getting assistance and for your own learning.

Practice these skills consistently, and you'll find that both giving and receiving technical help becomes much more effective and efficient.
