## 1. Data Management and File Directory Systems

Effective data management is the foundation of successful spatial data science work. Understanding how your operating system organizes files and directories is crucial for avoiding lost work, confusion, and technical problems.

### 1.1 Understanding File Directory Systems

File directory systems organize your files in a hierarchical tree structure. Each operating system handles this differently, and understanding these differences is essential for effective file management.

#### 1.1.1 macOS File System Structure

**Root Directory:**

- macOS uses a Unix-based file system starting with the root directory `/`
- User files are typically stored under `/Users/[username]/`
- Applications are stored in `/Applications/`

**Common User Directories:**

- **Desktop**: `/Users/[username]/Desktop/`
- **Documents**: `/Users/[username]/Documents/`
- **Downloads**: `/Users/[username]/Downloads/`
- **Home Directory**: `/Users/[username]/` (also referred to as `~`)

**Path Format:**

- macOS uses forward slashes `/` to separate directories
- Example: `/Users/jsmith/Documents/Earthsys144/Week01/data.shp`

**Showing Full Paths in Finder:**

1. Open **Finder**
2. Go to **View → Show Path Bar** (this shows the path at the bottom of the window)
3. Alternative: **View → Show Status Bar** and then **View → Customize Toolbar** and add the Path button
4. For copying paths: Right-click any file and hold the **Option key** to see "Copy [filename] as Pathname"
5. Command-line method: Open **Terminal** and type `pwd` to see your current directory path

#### 1.1.2 Windows File System Structure

**Drive Letters:**

- Windows uses drive letters (C:, D:, E:) as the root of each storage device
- The main system drive is typically `C:`
- External drives get assigned subsequent letters

**Common User Directories:**

- **Desktop**: `C:\Users\[username]\Desktop\`
- **Documents**: `C:\Users\[username]\Documents\`
- **Downloads**: `C:\Users\[username]\Downloads\`
- **User Profile**: `C:\Users\[username]\`

**Path Format:**

- Windows uses backslashes `\` to separate directories
- Example: `C:\Users\JSmith\Documents\Earthsys144\Week01\data.shp`

**Showing Full Paths in File Explorer:**

1. Open **File Explorer**
2. Click the **View** tab in the ribbon
3. Check the box for **File name extensions** (to see .shp, .csv, etc.)
4. For the address bar: Click **View → Options → View tab → Display the full path in the title bar**
5. Alternative: Click in the address bar (where it shows folder icons) and it will switch to text showing the full path
6. Copy path method: Hold **Shift** and right-click any file, then select "Copy as path"

### 1.2 Where NOT to Put Things (Critical - Read This First!)

**⚠️ WARNING**: Choosing the wrong location for your GIS files can lead to data corruption, software crashes, and lost work. These locations MUST be avoided:

#### 1.2.1 Cloud Sync Folders (Critical Warning)

**Problematic Locations:**

- **macOS**: `~/Desktop/`, `~/Documents/` if iCloud is enabled
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\[username]\OneDrive\` or Dropbox folders
- Any folder with a cloud sync icon

**Why These Cause Problems:**

Modern cloud storage services like iCloud, OneDrive, and Dropbox use "storage optimization" features that automatically move large files to the cloud to save local disk space. While this seems helpful, it creates serious problems for GIS software:

**Storage Optimization Issues:**

- **Files appear present but aren't actually local**: Cloud services show file icons and names, but the actual data is stored remotely
- **On-demand downloading**: When QGIS tries to access a file, the cloud service must first download it, causing delays and potential timeouts
- **Incomplete downloads**: If your internet connection is slow or interrupted, QGIS may try to read a partially downloaded file, causing corruption or crashes
- **"File not found" errors**: QGIS may report that files don't exist when they're actually just not downloaded locally

**Additional Problems:**

- Cloud services lock files while syncing, preventing GIS software access
- Sync conflicts can corrupt spatial data files, especially multi-file formats like Shapefiles
- Large spatial datasets may exceed storage quotas
- GIS software creates temporary files during processing that confuse sync services
- Multiple files (like .shp, .shx, .dbf) may sync at different times, breaking dataset integrity

**Solutions:**

- **macOS**: Turn off iCloud sync for Desktop and Documents in System Preferences → Apple ID → iCloud, or create your course folder outside synced areas like `/Users/[username]/Local_GIS/`
- **Windows**: Work outside OneDrive folders - create `C:\GIS_Projects\` or use `C:\Users\[username]\Local_GIS\` instead
- **Universal approach**: Create a dedicated non-synced folder for all GIS work, then manually backup completed projects to cloud storage
- **If you must use cloud folders**: Ensure "Keep on this device" or "Always available offline" is enabled for your GIS data folders

#### 1.2.2 Other Locations to Avoid

**System Folders:**

- Never store data in `/Applications/` (macOS) or `C:\Program Files\` (Windows)
- Avoid the root directory (`/` or `C:\`)
- Don't use system folders like `/tmp/` or `C:\Windows\Temp\`

**Network Drives:**

- Avoid storing active projects on network drives when possible
- Network interruptions can corrupt data
- Performance is often slower than local storage

### 1.3 Where to Put Things (Safe Locations)

Now that you know where NOT to store your files, here are the recommended safe locations and organization strategies:

**Recommended Course Structure:**

```
Earthsys144/                    # Main course folder
├── Week00/                     # Week-specific folders
│   ├── data/                   # Original and final data only
│   ├── working/                # Intermediate processing files
│   ├── exports/                # Screenshots, PDFs, final outputs
│   └── Week00_Lab01.qgz        # QGIS project file
├── Week01/
│   ├── data/
│   ├── working/
│   ├── exports/
│   └── Week01_Lab01.qgz        # Descriptive project naming
└── Week02/
    ├── data/
    ├── working/
    ├── exports/
    └── Week02_Lab01.qgz        # Week and lab specific
```

**Understanding Project Files vs. Data:**

**QGIS Project Files (.qgz):**

- **Small file size** (typically < 1MB) - contains NO actual data
- **Contains only references** (file paths) to your data files
- **Stores visualization instructions**: colors, symbols, layer order
- **Stores analysis instructions**: tool settings, relationships between layers
- **Easy to share and backup** due to small size

**Folder Organization Strategy:**

**`/data/` folder:**

- **Original datasets** as downloaded (never modify these!)
- **Final cleaned datasets** ready for analysis
- **Can become very large** (hundreds of MB to GB)
- **Keep it simple** - avoid too many intermediate versions here

**`/working/` folder:**

- **Intermediate processing files** created during analysis
- **Temporary outputs** from geoprocessing tools
- **Experimental datasets** you're testing
- **Can be deleted** periodically to save space

**`/exports/` folder:**

- **Screenshots** for homework and documentation
- **PDF maps** and layouts for submission
- **Exported final results** (charts, simplified datasets)
- **Presentation materials**

**Best Practices:**

- Create this structure in a **non-synced location** (see section 1.2.1 above)
- **Recommended locations**:
  - **macOS**: `/Users/[username]/Local_GIS/` or `/Users/[username]/GIS_Projects/`
  - **Windows**: `C:\GIS_Projects\` or `C:\Users\[username]\Local_GIS\`
- **Keep project files at the week level** - they reference all folder contents
- **Use descriptive filenames** without spaces (underscores or hyphens instead)
- **Clean out `/working/` folders** periodically to save disk space
- **Back up `/data/` and `/exports/`** regularly - `/working/` can be recreated if needed

## 2. Unzipping Files

Spatial data is often distributed in compressed formats (.zip, .tar.gz, .7z), and how you handle these files differs significantly between operating systems. Understanding these differences is crucial for GIS work.

### 2.1 macOS Behavior (Recommended)

**What happens when you double-click a .zip file:**

- macOS **automatically extracts** the contents to a new folder
- Creates a folder with the same name as the zip file (minus .zip extension)
- **Deletes the original .zip file** by default
- Files are immediately available for full read/write access

**Benefits for GIS work:**

- Files are fully extracted and accessible to QGIS
- Can edit, modify, and add fields to datasets
- No performance issues or access restrictions
- Works seamlessly with all GIS software

### 2.2 Windows Behavior (Problematic for GIS)

**What happens when you double-click a .zip file:**

- Windows **treats the zip file as a folder** that can be browsed
- Files appear to be accessible but are **still compressed**
- You can view files but they're not truly extracted
- The original .zip file remains intact

**Why this causes GIS problems:**

- **Limited access**: QGIS cannot fully access compressed files
- **Cannot edit**: Unable to add fields, modify attributes, or edit geometries
- **Performance issues**: Reading from compressed files is slower
- **Incomplete operations**: Some geoprocessing tools will fail
- **File locking**: Multiple software packages may conflict when accessing compressed files

**⚠️ Windows users must manually extract:**

1. **Right-click** the .zip file
2. Select **"Extract All..."** (not just double-click)
3. Choose a destination folder
4. Click **"Extract"** to fully uncompress files

### 2.3 Universal Best Practices

**For all operating systems:**

- **Always fully extract** compressed files before using in GIS software
- **Extract to your `/data/` folder** within your week directory
- **Verify extraction**: Check that all expected files are present
- **Organize immediately**: Move extracted files to appropriate subfolders
- **Keep original downloads**: Save original .zip files in a separate `/downloads/` folder for backup

**Common compressed formats in GIS:**

- **.zip**: Most common for shapefiles and small datasets
- **.tar.gz**: Common for large raster datasets and Linux distributions
- **.7z**: High compression format, requires 7-Zip software
- **.rar**: Less common, requires WinRAR or similar software

**Extraction verification checklist:**

- Shapefiles should have multiple files (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj)
- File sizes should be reasonable (not 0 bytes)
- Files should open properly in QGIS without errors
- You should be able to view attribute tables completely


## 3. Directory Navigation

Master these essential directory skills:

- Understand absolute vs. relative paths
- Navigate using both GUI and command line
- Create and organize folder hierarchies
- Understand how different operating systems handle paths

## Next Steps

With these fundamental computer skills in place, you're ready to learn about GIS data formats and naming conventions that will ensure your spatial data science work runs smoothly.
