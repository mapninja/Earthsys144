# Introduction to GIS Data Formats & Finding Spatial Data

## Overview

Understanding spatial data formats and knowing where to find quality data are fundamental skills in GIS. This guide covers the most common file formats you'll encounter and provides a comprehensive directory of data sources for your spatial analysis projects.

## Common GIS Data Formats

### Vector Data Formats

#### Shapefiles (.shp) - The Multi-File Format

- **What it is**: The most common vector data format, developed by Esri
- **Structure**: Actually consists of 3-15+ files working together as one dataset
- **Required files**: `.shp` (geometry), `.shx` (index), `.dbf` (attributes)

- **Limitations**:
  - 2GB file size limit per component
  - Field names ≤ 10 characters
  - 255 field limit
  - No mixed geometry types
- **Advantages**:
  - **Spatially indexed** for fast queries
  - **Supports topology** and advanced geometry operations
  - **Universal compatibility** across all GIS software
  - **Proven reliability** for complex spatial analysis
- **When to use**: Data sharing, archival storage, working with legacy systems, complex spatial analysis

#### GeoJSON (.geojson) - The Web Standard

## Search Strategies

### Google Earth Engine for Raster Data Analysis

**Why use Google Earth Engine for raster data?**

- **Analysis-ready data**: Pre-processed with atmospheric correction, cloud masking
- **Massive compute power**: Handle continental-scale analysis in the cloud
- **Time-series ready**: Decades of satellite data organized for temporal analysis
- **No download required**: Process petabytes of data without local storage
- **Reproducible research**: Code-based analysis with version control

**Key advantages marked with 🌍 throughout this guide:**

- Look for the 🌍 symbol next to datasets available in Google Earth Engine
- These datasets are optimized for analysis and ready to use in GEE
- Direct links provided to specific Earth Engine data catalog pages

### General Search Tips

- Use specific file format terms in your searches: "shapefile", "geotiff", "geojson", "geodatabase"
- Include geographic terms: city names, administrative boundaries, geographic features
- Combine data type with location: "California counties shapefile", "elevation data Colorado geotiff"
- **For raster analysis**: Consider Google Earth Engine first for satellite imagery and environmental data

### Data Quality Considerations

- Check metadata for coordinate systems, accuracy, and currency
- Verify data sources and collection methods
- Consider scale appropriateness for your analysis
- Review attribute completeness and standardization

### Legal and Licensing Considerations

- Always check data licensing and usage rights
- Government data is typically public domain in the U.S.
- Academic sources may have research-only restrictions
- Commercial data often requires licensing agreements

## Next Steps

With this foundation in data formats and sources, you're ready to:

1. Identify appropriate data formats for your projects
2. Locate and evaluate potential data sources
3. Understand the strengths and limitations of different formats
4. Make informed decisions about data acquisition and storage

Remember that the choice of data format often depends on your intended use, software requirements, and project constraints. When in doubt, start with widely-supported formats like shapefiles for vector data and GeoTIFF for raster data.
