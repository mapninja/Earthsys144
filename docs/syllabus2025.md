# **Fundamentals of Geographic Information Science (GIS) (ESS-164/EARTHSYS-144)**

## **Course Description:**

***"Everything is somewhere, and that somewhere matters."***

The rapid growth of spatial data technologies has transformed the use of location data, from administrative applications to personalized services. This course offers an overview of spatial data technologies and methodologies, including data creation, management, analysis, and presentation within a research context. Key topics include:

- Geographic data modeling and spatial thinking
- Field data collection
- Basic spatial statistics
- Remote sensing and satellite imagery
- Big Data and machine learning in spatial analysis
- Cartographic design and web-based StoryMap platforms

---

## **Learning Objectives:**

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Implement GIS and spatial data technologies in academic and professional settings.
2. Utilize software such as QGIS, ArcGIS Desktop, and Google Earth Engine.
3. Evaluate spatial data and understand data models, coordinate systems, and metadata.
4. Apply spatial data acquisition methods and perform spatial analysis.
5. Conduct spatial statistical analysis and complex spatial modeling.
