## Introduction

This exercise introduces students to the fundamentals of network visualization and routing using QGIS3. Networks are a critical component of Geographic Information Science (GIS), representing interconnected systems such as roads, railways, and utilities. By leveraging QGIS3's tools, students will learn how to visualize road networks, analyze their connectivity, and compute the shortest path between two points.

## Overview of the Task

Students will work with a dataset of San Francisco roadways to:

1. Visualize the connectivity of the road network.
2. Apply styling techniques to highlight one-way streets.
3. Perform network analysis to find the shortest path between two points.

This hands-on exercise will provide practical experience with network data and analysis tools in QGIS3.

## Objectives

By the end of this exercise, students will be able to:

1. Load and visualize network data in QGIS3.
2. Use rule-based styling to highlight one-way streets using data-defined overrides.
3. Perform network analysis to compute the shortest path between two points.
4. Create a cartographically sound map layout to present their results.
